I'm a young, passionate software engineer with a surprisingly vast skill set on enterprise software patterns,
performance optimizations, security & cloud environments.

In my spare time, I'm mostly active within the Minecraft community. Specifically, you'll often find me posting on
[SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/mrdienns.35704/), or working on my own business called
[Dyescape](https://dyescape.com). Minecraft may look like a silly, blocky game at first, but the technical iceberg
allows you to go wild. With Dyescape, that's exactly what we're doing; me and my team are working on becoming the
world's largest Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Minecraft server. After years of hard work, we
finally have a first version live in production. Currently we're working towards new content updates and a new software
setup using a distributed architecture, event sourcing & CQRS for future updates.

I actually don't drink coffee.
